# BME680

Simple Teensy 3.X sketch that configures and initializes the sensors, reads the sensor data, and spews to the serial monitor scaled temperature, pressure, and humidity from Bosch's latest BME680 environmental sensor. I am getting resistance from the gas sensor in forced mode and so far everything is working as expected. I haven't got the gas sensor to work in sequential mode yet, and I have yet to interpret the measured resistance in terms of gas concentration. Still working on it...
